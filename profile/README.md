## What are these mods?
### Starix
Starix is a modification of Windows to look like Windows 95 / 98 (mostly 98).

### Classic 7
Classic 7 is a modifcation of windows to look like Windows 7.

## Why should I use either mod?
Starix / Classic 7 are for people who want the old design yet still have a somewhat modern version of Windows. 

We are using tiny10 21H2 as the base of our operating systems and modifying them appropriately to their Windows version lookalike (9x / Windows 7)

## Are there any viruses?
No. We do not host any viruses in our operating systems. We try to use as much FOSS software as we can in our mods such as Windhawk and Open Shell.
