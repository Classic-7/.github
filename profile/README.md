## Welcome!
Welcome to the Starix / Classic 7 GitHub page! We post stuff that we use in our operating systems here such as [Wallpapers](https://github.com/strxproject/Wallpapers).
### What is Starix / Classic 7?
> Starix is a Windows 10 mod that tries to look identical to Windows 98. 

> Classic 7 is a Windows 10 mod that tries to look identical to Windows 7.
### Why use Starix / Classic 7?
If you want the classic look of 9x or Windows 7, you can try out either of our operating systems. You will need to wipe your drive to install it but otherwise we try to get as close as possible to the OS we are trying to look like (e.g, Windows 98)
### Is Starix / Classic 7 safe?
We try to use as much community software as we can and use as much open source software as we can to replicate the original look. We can reassure you Starix / Classic 7 is not virus-ridden at all.

TL;DR: Yes.
### Is Starix / Classic 7 1:1?
No. It will probably never be 1:1 as it's too hard to just make it the way to use to be. We try our hardest to make it the closest we can to the original, but we can't assure you it is 1:1.
