## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the Starix Project repository!

This is where you will find all Starix Files, software and etc.
### What is Starix?
Starix is a Windows customisation project ment to bring the 9x design over to newer versions such as Windows 10

We use mostly open source apps such as, RetroBar by [dremin](https://github.com/dremin) and OpenShell by the [Open-Shell team](https://github.com/Open-Shell).
### Why use Starix?
Starix is for people that want to bring back the old design while still remaining functional by using Windows 10 as the base.

We are just a small team messing around with Windows and such.
